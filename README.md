This is just a portable launcher for FreeMind. Does not contain an installer nor am I planning on making one.
You can simply use the contents of this package as long as you specify Java location in FreeMindPortable.ini.

The launcher was written using [AutoIt](http://www.autoitscript.com) which is a free
automation tool and similar to [NSIS](http://nsis.sourceforge.net) in many regards.

This launcher is provided AS IS without any warranty. You will use the launcher at your own risk.
I have tested the launcher to work on Windows 7 Ultimate (64bit) and as it's a 32bit UPX-packed EXE
it should work on WinXP, Vista and Win7 on both 32bit and 64bit systems. Nevertheless I do not make
any guarantee that it will work on any particular system.
